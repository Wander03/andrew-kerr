This consulting project was part of my graduate consulting curriculum, where 
students provide statistical consulting for the statistics department. 

The client (Patrick Michelsen) was an Environmental Management M.S. student 
working on their thesis project. Patrick needed guidance on what statistical
method to use for his randomized complete block design study with 6 response 
values. His main issue was he has many missing values and values under the limit
of detection (LOD), aka left censored.

My group presented two approaches: 

- Using Bayesian Statistics with the `brms` library, which allowed us to use a 
mixed model with left censored data

- Treating the LOD values as 0 and using a Zero-Inflated model to separately 
model the LOD and actual values

For the two response variables without any LOD values, we presented generalized 
linear mixed models.
