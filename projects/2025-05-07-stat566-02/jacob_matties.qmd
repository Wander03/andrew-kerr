This consulting project was part of my graduate consulting curriculum, where 
students provide statistical consulting for the statistics department. 

The client (Jacob Matties) was a ME M.S. student working on their thesis project. 
Jacob needed help determining whether a smartphone placed in different locations 
(shirt pocket, pants pocket, handheld) could detect differences in balance between 
different stances (single leg, both legs, tandem).

My group used a generalized linear mixed model to detect this difference. In our
report, we provided Jacob with instructions for how to perform this analysis in 
JMP as well as our findings and interpretations of the analysis. We checked the
JMP output with SAS output as well to be thorough.
