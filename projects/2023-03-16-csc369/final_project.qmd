We had the option of using Hadoop or Pyspark for this project since we learned 
both during the course, I chose to use Pyspark.

For the final project for this course, I investigated electric vehicle ownership
within Washington as of February 17, 2023. My focus was to answer the 
following questions:

- Has there been an increase in electric vehicle ownership within the past few years?

- What make of vehicle was the most popular each year? Within each make, was there a stand out model?

- Are there more Full Electric or Hybrid vehicles currently registered? Do different cities favor one type over the other? Do counties? Do Postal Codes?

At the end of my analysis, I could conclude that over time there has been an 
increase in ownership of electric vehicles in Washington; with larger increases 
in the past two years. From 2011 to 2017, the Nissan Leaf was the most popular 
vehicle (I owned one of those!), and from 2018 to present day Tesla has held the 
reigns. Currently full electric vehicles are the most popular compared against 
hybrid vehicles, regardless of location. This follows what we saw from question 
2 since Tesla, a full electric vehicle manufacturer, has been the dominate make 
for the past few years.
