This project consisted of 2 practice clients to prepare us for real client 
projects. Alongside preparing reports for these clients, we gave in person 
presentations!

### Client A

The first client, Booze 'R' Us, requested a method by which to predict future sales for growth
purposes. We proposed a machine learning approach fitting a multiple linear
regression model to historical monthly sales data from Booze 'R' Us's storefronts
and applied the modeling process to a case study similar in scope. The model was
fit to historical data and accurately predicted future monthly sales for an average
storefront. Furthermore, the features included reflected factors that we found tend
to drive or have the greatest impact on monthly liquor sales. Through our
analysis, we selected three main feature setups and evaluated each to finalize
using month, size of bottles, price, and type of alcohol. In addition to developing a
robust predictive model, we identified specific sizes, price ranges, and liquor
types that serve as the primary drivers of sales.

### Client B

The second client, Drinking Excess Alcohol is Dangerous (DEAD), was interested in 
the driving factors behind small and large alcohol purchases in Iowa. We proposed 
a machine learning model fitting a multiple linear regression model to a random 
sample of past sales data. The model fits sales data and predicts the quantity 
of alcohol purchased. The features of the final model represent the most 
influential factors driving alcohol purchasing behavior. This investigation has 
revealed valuable insights that can guide DEAD in shaping responsible alcohol 
retailing initiatives, with a focus on seasonal, category-specific, and college 
town-targeted campaigns, while upholding ethical principles of transparency and 
data privacy.
