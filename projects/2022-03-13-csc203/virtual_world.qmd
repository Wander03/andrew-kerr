At the beginning of the Quarto we were given a single Java file with everything 
to run the game put into it (a non-object oriented style). Throughout the quarter, 
I applied different object-oriented programming techniques to this project.

- Project 1: Move almost all static methods in the file Functions.java to the appropriate class

- Project 2: Eliminate function duplication by refactoring the duplication into new abstract classes

- Project 3: Refactor the duplicate variables/methods into a hierarchy of abstract classes

- Project 4: Modify the pathing behavior of all entities that move within the world (A* Pathing)

- Project 5: Modify the virtual world to support a "world-changing" event. This event is to be triggered by a mouse press and must have a localized effect. The event must be visualized by changing the affected background tiles and by modifying the affected entities. In addition, the world event must create a new type of entity

Changes made to the code were planned out beforehand in a UML using draw.io. I 
have multiple versions of my UML at each project point.
