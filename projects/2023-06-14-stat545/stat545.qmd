This class did not have a final project, however it had multiple challenging 
projects throughout the Quarter.

### Simple Random Walk

This project required me to write my own simple random walk function and use it
to answer multiple questions

[Project 1 Report](/files/stat545/simple_random_walk.html){target="_blank"}

### Markov Chains

This project required me to write my own code to simulate markov chains and 
approximate distributions.

[Project 2 Report](/files/stat545/markov_chains.html){target="_blank"}

### More Markov Chains

This project required me to further explore markov chains, absorption states, and
stationary distributions.

[Project 3 Report](/files/stat545/more_MC.html){target="_blank"}

### Chutes and Ladders and MCMC

This project had me create a board of chutes and ladders, following specific set up
rules. Throughout the project I explored time to absorption (how many turns it takes 
to get to the end of the board) and used simulation to determine the placement of 
each chute and ladder to minimize and maximize the time to absorption.

### Costco Time Markov Chains

This project had me create a Costco gas station, fully equipped with multiple islands,
pumps, and wait times. I simulated a multitude of items such as the distribution of 
number of cars in the system, fraction of time there are no cars in the system, 
and customer wait time. I created different types of cars (i.e. will only join queues on the right)
using `setClass` for easy tracking!
