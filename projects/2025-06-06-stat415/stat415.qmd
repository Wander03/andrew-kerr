The final project for this class had my group explore a past Frequentist Analysis
in a Bayesian light. Since I worked with the same person for my Survival Analysis
final project, we decided to use this analysis. 

We implement a Bayesian Weibull proportional hazards model. The Weibull 
distribution was chosen based on the parametric survival analysis from our Stat 
417 report, which identified it as the best-fitting distribution 
(Anderson-Darling test statistic = 16986.795). We will use the same predictors 
in the Bayesian model as we did in our frequentist model to enable a direct 
comparison between the two.

The Bayesian and frequentist approaches yielded similar estimates for key effects:

- Contract effects differ by less than 2%

- Payment method effects are consistent in direction and similar in magnitude

- Both identify the same key predictors of churn

The main differences are:

- The Bayesian approach doesn't suffer from proportional hazards violations

- We get full posterior distributions rather than point estimates
