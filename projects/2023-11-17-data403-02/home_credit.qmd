This project consisted of a practice clients to prepare us for real client 
projects. Alongside preparing reports for this client, we gave an in person 
presentation!

The overview we were provided was:

You are a data scientist at a bank working in the mortgages division. You have 
been tasked with building a model to predict whether an applicant will be able 
to repay their loan. Use the data from 
[this Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/), 
specifically the data in application_train.csv, to build and evaluate your model.

Furthermore, we were limited to implementing the machine learning algorithms,
metrics, and cross-validation process from scratch.

My group performed the following tasks and detailed our decisions and methods 
in our report:

- The first section, “Data Collection and Preparation,” includes a description of the data
set, cleaning and preprocessing steps, and feature selection rationale.

- The second section, “Model Selection and Validation,” includes an overview of the
models: logistic regression, support vector machines, and linear discriminant analysis,
along with criteria for model comparison and selection.

- The third section, “Final Model, ” provides a detailed description and justification of the
chosen final model.

- The fourth section, “Ethical Concerns,” includes a summary of potential biases in the
model and recommendations for ethical use.

- The fifth section, “Conclusion,” summarizes our key findings and their significance.
