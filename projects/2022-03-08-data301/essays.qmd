For the final project for this course, we applied the techniques learned in this 
class to analyze a data set of personal interest to you. My group decided to 
extend the ability to auto grade multiple choice and short response questions
to essay questions, with a focus on sentiment analysis.

We acquired over 11k essays from the Hewlett Foundation on Kaggle written by 
students in grades 7 to 10 with 8 different prompts. Using the scores given to
these essays along with a polarity value from a sentiment analysis API, we created
two K-Nearest Neighbors models. One model predicted the essays grade based on the 
words in the essay (TF-IDF), and the other on the polarity score of the essay. 
Both models were run on each essay prompt individually as well as all essays at 
once.

When comparing the two models, on average the predictions from the polarity 
models performed better than those from the TF/TF-IDF models. This supports our 
findings from our data exploration; that the polarity does affect the score.

From the data we acquired, accounting for the grade of the writer, type of essay, 
the polarity, and the general polarity of the writing produces the best results.
Furthermore, with the amount of samples we had, looking at all the essays overall provides better
predictions than each prompt separately. With larger sample sizes of each prompt, we would
expect the opposite conclusion since focusing on essays only from a single prompt results in less
unexplained variability between the essays. Furthermore, we discovered that the polarity of an
essay is correlated with different scores, as it proved to be a fairly good predictor on its own
when compared to the TF-IDF model.
