The final project for this class had my group explore a dataset using survival 
analysis. 

We decided to use the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which is a fictional dataset 
created by IBM to simulate customer data for a telecommunications company. This 
dataset was designed to help predict customer churn, referring to customers who 
stop using the companyâ€™s services, with the goal of analyzing customer behavior 
and developing strategies to retain customers.

Our report is split into three sections: parametric survival analysis, 
non-parametric survival analysis, and cox regression. The parametric analysis
was done in JMP, while the latter two approaches were done in R.
