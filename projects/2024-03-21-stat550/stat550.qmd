For the final project of this class, I was given a dataset and asked to perform 
exploratory data analysis to find:

- Find a model that “best” explains the relationship between your response variable(s) and the
predictor variables, then interpret those relationships

- Make predictions (either probabilities or counts—as appropriate) from your final model

My final model ended up being a negative binomial generalized linear model
with a log link. The Project Log details the steps I took to get to this final
model.
