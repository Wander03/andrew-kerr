    "text": "For my thesis, I contributed new functionality to the tidyclust package in R. The tidyclust package exists as a part of the tidymodels framework , which follows the principles of the tidyverse to establish a consistent and reproducible workflow for unsupervised learning algorithms. My work adapted the Apriori and ECLAT algorithms for frequent itemset mining. This involved establishing a cluster assignment strategy that groups items based on frequent itemsets and support values, as well as a standardized methodology for predicting missing items. You can read more about my design choices in my paper or see them in my presentation!\nThesis Paper - Frequent Itemset Mining with tidyclust in R\nThesis Code - tidyclust Package\nThesis Presentation"

Patrick needed guidance on what statistical method to use for his randomized complete block design study with 6 response values. His main issue was he has many missing values and values under the limit of detection (LOD), aka left censored.\nMy group presented two approaches:\n\nUsing Bayesian Statistics with the brms library, which allowed us to use a mixed model with left censored data\nTreating the LOD values as 0 and using a Zero-Inflated model to separately model the LOD and actual values\n\nFor the two response variables without any LOD values, we presented generalized linear mixed models.\nGithub Repo\nReport"

Elsa needed help determining whether the IMU data is “close enough” to the motion capture data, and how to best summarise and present these findings across all 30 participants in her results section.\nIn summary, my group did the following:\n\nData Management (combine files, align times, calculate curve characteristics)\nCompare curves wholistically (visually, correlation coefficients, dynamic time warping)\nCompare characteristics of curves using linear mixed models (e.g., proportion of time spent in harmful posture, range of motion, etc.)\n\nGithub Repo\nReport"

    "text": "This data science capstone project developed an automated system to classify World Bank projects and summarize their activities, specifically focusing on broadband connectivity. The project addressed the challenge of encapsulating the World Bank’s impact due to the complexity and quantity of its projects.\nThe solution involved a three-step process:\n\nClassification: Two approaches, a Naïve approach and a Large Language Model (LLM) approach (using BERT and Llama models), were employed to classify projects based on whether they relate to broadband connectivity by analyzing indicator names.\nFiltering: Classified indicators were refined to ensure only the most up-to-date observations were kept and that ‘Progress Values’ were numerical.\nAggregation: Progress for each indicator was computed and converted to counts where necessary.\n\nThe project compared the Naïve, BERT, and Llama models, identifying their strengths and weaknesses in classification. Future steps include a hybrid classification approach combining BERT and TF-IDF, refining filtering and aggregation methods for LLM outputs, and leveraging pre-labeled data from the World Bank for enhanced model training and evaluation. Additionally, the BART-large-mnli model showed promise towards the end of the project, and could further enhance classification capabilities.\nDue to an NDA, I can not share the github repository or data.\nReport\nPoster\nSlides"

Noah had come to the consulting department a few weeks earlier to help design his study, and has returned with collected data. He put three devices on his subjects to measure the angle of their spine while sitting, with the goal of showing that all three devices are necessary to measure different postures.\nThe first part of his study was 15 minutes of unstructured time. From this data he wanted summary statistics. The second part of the study had the subjects following a guided video where they would perform multiple postures (good, laying back, lumbar slouch, etc.). From this data he wanted what angle thresholds and combinations that resulted in poor posture (anything that wasn’t good posture) and to mark these postures in the 15 minutes of unstructured time.\nMy group did the following:\n\nUsed linear mixed models to determine the confidence and prediction intervals for each posture for each device in the structured time (guided video section)\nCreated visualizations showing that each device was able to identify different postures, requiring all three devices to detect all postures\nApplied the prediction intervals to the 15 minutes of unstructured time to create plots for each subject, as well as summary statistics across all subjects (e.g. time spent in each posture)\n\nGithub Repo\nReport"
